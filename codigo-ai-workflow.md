## ðŸš€ Introduction

Codigo DevAI was utilized throughout the development lifecycle of this project to enhance productivity, streamline coding, and automate repetitive tasks.

## ðŸ§  Why Codigo DevAI?

- Smart code suggestions powered by AI
- Accelerated development and debugging
- Context-aware assistance for Solana/Anchor development
- Seamless integration into IDE for real-time feedback

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Overview

### 1. **Project Planning**

- Used Codigo DevAI to build on my initial project logic
- Outlined folder structure and planned modular microservices.

### 2. **Smart Code Generation**

- Used Codigo DevAI for generating Anchor program modules with boilerplate and procedural macros.
- Automated generation of instruction handlers, accounts struct, and validation logic.

### 3. **IDL Generation**

- Used to build Anchor the program

### 4. **Testing & Debugging**

- Debug suggestions were given by Codigo DevAI based on Anchor error codes and test outputs.
- Helped fix unresolved imports, invalid account errors, and instruction validation failures.

### 5. **Documentation**

- Codigo DevAI helped generate this Markdown document summarizing the process.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Anchor framework structure, with Codigo DevAI helping to organize files logically:

```
vault/
â”œâ”€â”€ Anchor.toml           # Anchor configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml            # Rust dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ programs/             # Program source code
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ devquest_vault/   # Main program directory
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # Program logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ errors.rs         # Error definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ instructions/     # Instruction handlers
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ close.rs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deposit.rs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ initialize.rs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ payee.rs
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ withdraw.rs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs            # Program entry point
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ state.rs          # Account structures
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                # Test scripts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ devquest_vault.ts # Main test file
â””â”€â”€ migrations/           # Deployment scripts
    â””â”€â”€ deploy.ts         # Deployment script
```

## âœ… Benefits Realized

- 3x faster iteration
- Reduced boilerplate and syntax errors
- Enhanced learning through contextual AI explanations
- More time spent on logic and architecture, less on repetitive syntax

## ðŸ›  Tools & Commands Used

```bash
anchor build
anchor test
```

> Codigo DevAI plugged into IDE to assist with the above.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

Using Codigo DevAI, VSCode, alongside Anchor and Solana tools provided a robust, efficient, and AI-enhanced workflow to ship high-quality code faster and with greater confidence.
